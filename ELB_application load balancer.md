# AWS ELB #

#### What is ELB used for ####

##### Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets and virtual appliances in one or more Availability Zones (AZs). #####

##### Your incoming traffic is automatically split among numerous targets, including EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses in one or more Availability Zones, thanks to elastic load balancing. It keeps track of the health of the registered targets, only sending traffic to those that are in good shape. As the volume of incoming traffic changes over time, elastic load balancing scales your load balancer. The great majority of workloads can be handled by it automatically scaling.#####

##### Application load balancers, network load balancers, gateway load balancers, and classic load balancers are all supported by elastic load balancing (ELB). The load balancer type that best meets your demands can be chosen. In this manual, application load balancers are covered. #####
