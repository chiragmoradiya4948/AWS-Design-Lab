# AWS CodePipeline:

AWS CodePipeline is a continuous delivery solution that allows you to model, visualise, and automate the steps required for software deployment. The various stages of a software release process can be simply defined and configured. CodePipeline streamlines the actions required to continually release software modifications. 

## Continuous delivery: 

It is a software development methodology that automates the release process. Every software update is built, tested, and pushed into production automatically. A person, an automated test, or a business rule determines when the final push to production should occur. Although with continuous delivery, any successful software change can be immediately published to production, not all changes must be released immediately. 

## Continuous integration: 

It is a software development approach in which team members use a version control system and often merge their work into the same location, such as a main branch. Each update is created and tested in order to find integration flaws as soon as possible.Â Continuous integration is focused on automatically building and testing code, as compared to continuous delivery, which automates the entire software release process up to production.
