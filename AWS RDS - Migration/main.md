# What is RDS
Amazon RDS provides scalable relational database capacity at a low cost while automating time-consuming administration tasks like hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. It frees you up to focus on your applications, allowing you to provide them with the high availability, security, and compatibility they require.

# Benefits and Features
# 1) Easy to Administer: 
Amazon RDS makes it easy to go from project conception to deployment. Access the capabilities of a production-ready relational database in minutes. No need for infrastructure provisioning, and no need for installing and maintaining database software.
2) Available and Durable
Amazon RDS lets you deploy a database across multiple Availability Zones and automatically fails over to a standby instance in case of an outage. Amazon RDS has many other features that enhance reliability for critical production databases, including automated backups, database snapshots, and host replacements.
3) Highly Scalable
You can scale your database's compute and storage resources with only a few mouse clicks or an API call, often with no downtime. Many Amazon RDS engine types allow you to launch one or more Read Replicas to offload read traffic from your primary database instance.
4) Fast
Amazon RDS supports the most demanding database applications. You can choose between two SSD-backed storage options: one optimized for high-performance OLTP applications, and the other for cost-effective general-purpose use.
