# What is CloudWatch

Amazon CloudWatch is an accuracy and monitoring service designed for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers (SREs), IT managers, and product owners. CloudWatch provides data and actionable insights to help you monitor your applications, respond to changes in system performance, and optimise resource utilisation. Logs, metrics, and events are used by CloudWatch to collect monitoring and operational data. You gain complete visibility of your AWS resources, applications, and services running on AWS and on-premises, as well as a unified view of operational health.
